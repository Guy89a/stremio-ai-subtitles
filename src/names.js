// Proper names, decided once for the whole episode.
//
// Two problems this fixes, both seen in real use:
//
//   "Billy the Kid" came back as a name plus a translated word, because in the
//   middle of a line it reads as a name followed by an ordinary noun. The rule
//   "keep proper names as they are" does not fire, since only half of it looks
//   like a name.
//
//   Chunks are translated independently, so the same character can be spelled
//   one way early in an episode and another way later. Nothing in a chunk can
//   see what another chunk chose.
//
// Both are solved before translation starts: collect the names locally, ask
// the model once how to write each one, and hand that list to every chunk.

// Words that begin a sentence and therefore get capitalised without being
// names. Only used to judge a single capitalised word.

For each one, give the exact form to use in ${lang.name}, and use it consistently everywhere.

RULES:
- A name with an epithet is ONE name, decided as a whole. The epithet is a title made of ordinary words, so it is TRANSLATED by what it means as a title - the way ${lang.name} history books and film titles do it: Billy the Kid is "Billy" plus the ${lang.name} word for a young man or lad (in Hebrew: בילי הנער), never a word for a young goat; Jack the Ripper and Ivan the Terrible likewise translate their epithets. If ${lang.name} conventionally keeps the whole name in English, keep it whole and unchanged.
- NEVER mix the two: do not translate "the" and transliterate the rest (הקיד, הד קיד, el Kid). Either the whole epithet is translated, or the whole name stays as it is.
- Where a well-known person, place, or work already has a standard form in ${lang.name}, use the standard form rather than inventing one.
- A nickname, company, gang or institution that is called by ordinary words - "the House", "the Company", "the Butcher Shop", "the Regulators" - is TRANSLATED by meaning, the way a human subtitler would, never transliterated. Give the plain form; the translator adds articles and prefixes as the grammar of each sentence needs.
- A capitalised word for a MEMBER of a group or institution takes that group's established term, read from the sample line - never the everyday meaning of the word: a Mason who joins a lodge is a Freemason (Hebrew: בונה חופשי), not a builder; a Regulator in a western is one of the Regulators, a Ranger one of the Rangers.
- A real place (a town, county, river, country) keeps its name, transliterated, even when its English words have a meaning: White Oaks stays White Oaks in ${lang.name} letters. Only ordinary words attached to it are translated: "Lincoln County" gives the ${lang.name} word for county plus Lincoln.
- Otherwise transliterate by sound, in the ${lang.name} writing system.
- Titles such as Doctor, Detective or Mrs. ARE translated; the name after them is not.
- If ${lang.name} conventionally keeps foreign names in Latin letters, say so by returning the name unchanged.
- If an entry is NOT actually a proper name - an ordinary word that only looks like one because it starts a sentence, such as "Listen" or "Call", or a shout or sound such as "Hyah" or "Whoa" - return it with the form SKIP. Forcing an ordinary word into one fixed form would break grammar elsewhere.
- Return every entry given, once each, and nothing else.
